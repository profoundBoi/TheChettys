    <p>There are two versions of how Kindle and Josh met.</p>

    <p><strong>Version One:</strong> They were five, in the same swimming academy. Josh “beat” Kindle at the gala, with external help 
      (we’re not naming names, but if you’re reading this and your conscience feels heavy... it should). Technically, that’s their first meeting, 
      and Kindle has never let it go.</p>

    <p><strong>Version Two:</strong> The official version. The one they tell at dinners, in speeches, and to curious aunts. Caleb, Josh’s cousin 
      and Kindle’s longest friend, introduced them during Grade 8 orientation. Josh was shorter, quieter, funny, and smarter than she expected. 
      Kindle was loud, competitive, and, according to her mother and brothers, declared him her academic rival within the first week.</p>

    <p>They’re not wrong.</p>

    <p>She noticed him first. Liked him first. And, in a move that shocked no one who knows her, made the first move by asking him to be her 
      Grade 11 debs ball date. Iconic behaviour, honestly.</p>

    <p>Their first unofficial date was a Mugg & Bean lunch followed by a movie, subtly gatecrashed by Josh’s older brother Danillo, who offered to 
      drive and then mysteriously didn’t leave immediately. He didn’t stay long, but long enough to go down in family history.</p>

    <p>By Grade 10, Kindle and Josh were seatmates in English class. She allegedly stole his lunch. Kindle has declined to comment. Josh claims 
      he never saw that sandwich again.</p>

    <p>High school sweethearts is the easiest way to sum them up, but the truth is, they grew into each other over time. Josh fell in love with 
      her that year. Quietly. Softly. In the background. It took him two years to say it out loud. He clearly likes to run a full diagnostic 
      before committing.</p>

    <p>(He also waited nine more years to propose, so this checks out.)</p>

    <p><strong>The proposal?</strong> Pure Kindle-and-Josh chaos.</p>

    <p>They were 4x4-ing through the dunes in Namibia, when they reached the spot where the desert meets the sea. Josh wanted a photo. 
      Suspicious. Kindle face-planted into the sand, very on brand, and while she was brushing sand out of her eyelashes, Josh was casually 
      down on one knee. She was so stunned, she forgot to say yes. He was still kneeling. Everyone was shouting “SAY YES!”. She nodded, finally. 
      Hugged him. And just like that, only nine years later, they were engaged.</p>

    <p><strong>Now, here they are.</strong></p>

    <p>She’s a literature-loving English teacher who’s fiercely devoted to Ferrari. He’s a math-brained car guy with an unwavering loyalty to Red 
      Bull Racing. They’re generally on the same team unless it’s race day. He can tell when her social battery is running low just by the way 
      she blinks. She keeps him endlessly entertained with dramatic retellings of otherwise uneventful days. Together, they’re living proof that 
      opposites not only attract, but they also thrive. And occasionally steal each other’s lunch.</p>

    <p><strong>And now? They get to do forever.</strong></p>

    <p><em>Finally.</em></p>

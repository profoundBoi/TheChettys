        <h2>Bestman – Danillo</h2>

        <p>Every hero needs a sidekick or in my case, an older brother who somehow became both the hero and the sidekick in my life. Danillo has 
          been there since day one, literally. He was the first person to teach me how to tie my shoes, how to not panic when life feels like a 
          giant group project, and how to fake confidence until it becomes real (which, let’s be honest, works 60% of the time, every time).</p>

        <p>He’s been the voice of reason in a lot of my "what was I thinking" moments, the calm in my chaos, and a consistent source of guidance, 
          whether I wanted it or not. Danillo sees the best in me even when I’m at my “10 car deadline, day before Camp Fest” worst.</p>

        <p>He’s dependable in the way that makes you forget how rare that is. A quiet encourager. A steady presence. A human compass who has kept 
          me grounded while always pointing me toward something better.</p>

        <p>If you ever meet someone who embodies loyalty and wisdom but can also roast you without blinking congrats, you’ve met Danillo. And I’m 
          lucky enough to call him my brother.</p>

      <h2>Groomsman – Caleb</h2>
        <p>You know how every great love story has that one chaotic, hilarious side character who somehow plays Cupid even though they can’t commit 
          to a dinner reservation? That’s Caleb.</p>

        <p>My first best friend, my cousin, and Kindle’s longest friend, which basically makes him the social architect of this wedding. He 
          introduced us, possibly thinking it would be temporary and funny. Plot twist: we fell in love. So yeah, Caleb, this is kind of your 
          fault.</p>

        <p>He’s the guy who never needs a plan because he is the plan. The kind of cousin who will suggest skydiving at midnight, then show up 
          with snacks and a backup parachute. Growing up, he was always ready to take the blame when something broke, got stained, or mysteriously 
          disappeared. And somehow, my parents still like him better than me.</p>

        <p>Caleb is comedy wrapped in loyalty, chaos wrapped in heart. And while he’s always been the one cracking jokes, behind all the laughter 
          is someone who’s been constant, courageous, and the best kind of trouble since day one. Every story needs a wild card. Caleb is ours.</p>

        <h2>Groomsman – Connór</h2>
        <p>Ah yes, Connór, Kindle’s brother, but more importantly, the little brother I never knew I needed… until he showed up in my life with
          dry humor, blunt honesty, and an unsettling ability to read me.</p>

        <p>He’s the guy who will absolutely roast your haircut, question your taste in music, and then turn around and give you the most grounded, 
          soul-punching advice you didn’t even know you needed. Steadfast. Driven. Inspiring in a quiet “lead by example” kind of way. And yes, 
          absurdly talented, but too humble to ever admit it unless it involves anime rankings.</p>

        <p>We’ve shared some sacred brotherly milestones: I gave him his first hangover and the cure (hydration and greasy food, you’re welcome), 
          taught him how to drive stick without crying (neither of us, shockingly), and found a shared emotional safe space in the form of 
          late-night anime marathons and half-asleep couch cuddles.</p>

        <p>Connór isn’t loud about his love, but he shows up fully, always. And that makes him not just a groomsman, but family in every sense 
          of the word. And maybe our obsession with “My Hero Academia.” That runs deep.</p>

        <h2>Maid of Honor – Jánine</h2>

        <p>Jánine isn’t just Josh’s sister, she’s the sister God clearly designed just for me. Like, handcrafted. Custom built. Gift wrapped with 
          chaotic good energy and a heart that somehow fits the whole world inside it.</p>

        <p>She’s my “I have an idea” partner-in-crime. No matter how wild the plan, a spontaneous trip, a 12-hour movie binge, or an activity 
          that definitely should’ve required waivers, Jánine is already putting her shoes on before I finish the sentence. She is the definition 
          of down for anything, with a side of "should we have thought this through?" (We never do. It’s better that way.)</p>

        <p>She loves fiercely, shows up fully, and delivers poorly timed jokes with such commitment that they become legendary. She’s honest in a 
          way that’s never cruel, only clarifying, the kind of person who’ll tell you when your outfit is questionable but hype you up anyway 
          because you’re wearing it with confidence.</p>

        <p>She’s my travel buddy, my movie-watching soul twin, and the sweet, steady presence I never knew I needed until she walked into my life 
          and made herself permanent.</p>
        
        <p>If brides get to choose their Maid of Honour, then I got the lottery win of a lifetime. And if you don’t know Jánine yet, buckle up,
          she’s the kind of person who makes you braver just by standing next to her.</p>

     <h2>Bridesmaid – Radia</h2>

        <p>Radia is my baby cousin, but calling her that feels wildly insufficient, because in reality, she’s my hype woman, my cuddle partner, 
          my personal baker, my hot drink soulmate, and the quiet glue behind so many of my best girlhood memories.</p>

        <p>She’s the person I binge-watch entire series with until our eyeballs are dry, the one who lets me play full-time hairstylist without 
          complaint (and with suspiciously good results), and the only person I know who will enthusiastically slip into a gown just to watch a 
          movie in her living room, snacks in hand, candles lit, soft blankets everywhere, like royalty in pajamas.</p> 

        <p>Radia is pure heart. All integrity. A sweet honesty that makes you feel safe, even when she’s telling you the hard stuff. She’s always 
          in my corner, always matching my energy, whether I’m spiraling or soaring, she’s right there with me, grounded and glowing.</p>

        <p>She’s got that quiet adaptability that makes her fit into any space, but she never disappears. She adds. She brings light. And she does 
          it without asking for anything in return, except maybe a sip of your tea and a spot on the couch.</p>

        <p>To know Radia is to be seen, supported, and occasionally buried under a weighted blanket during an emotional episode of something we 
          swore we weren’t going to cry over. She is magic. And I’m endlessly lucky to have her in my life and in this moment, by my side.</p>

     <h2>Bridesman – Ryan</h2>

        <p>Ryan is my best friend and, unfortunately for him, also four days older than me, which means I never let him forget he’s ancient. 
          He was actually Josh’s friend first (plot twist), but somewhere along the way, I stole him. No regrets.</p>

        <p>We met in high school, bonded over shared transport rides, and somewhere between missed homework and lunch swaps, our friendship locked in for 
          life.</p> 

        <p>Our dynamic is best described as "one shared brain cell, passed back and forth depending on the time of day and how much sleep either 
          one of us has had.” I'm usually the one who's right, he will deny this and we’ve mastered the art of communicating entirely through 
          memes, off-key song lyrics, and obscure movie quotes no one else understands. It’s pure magic, honestly.</p>

        <p>We’re both obsessed with Formula 1, anime, and elite-level TV series, most of which I proudly recommend and he pretends to resist 
          before becoming fully obsessed. We also have an uncanny ability to predict the best characters in every show, which is an elite gift 
          (if you ask me)</p>

        <p>At some point, Ryan became the honorary sibling and adopted child of my family, which meant if he wasn’t studying or doing dishes, he 
          was shouted at like any other child of the house. Equal rights, equal responsibilities.</p>

        <p>He's brave. Kind. The first to make a joke in tense moments, the first to have your back when things get hard, and the absolute last person who 
          wants to be told what to do (which I obviously do often, for character development).</p>

        <p>Even though he lives in Cape Town and I’m in Joburg, our friendship somehow ignores geography. No matter the distance, the memes still 
          come through, the chaos stays intact, and the love never misses a beat.</p>

        <h2>Bestman – Danilo</h2>

        <p>Every hero needs a sidekick or in my case, an older brother who somehow became both the hero and the sidekick in my life. Danillo has 
          been there since day one, literally. He was the first person to teach me how to tie my shoes, how to not panic when life feels like a 
          giant group project, and how to fake confidence until it becomes real (which, let’s be honest, works 60% of the time, every time).</p>

        <p>He’s been the voice of reason in a lot of my "what was I thinking" moments, the calm in my chaos, and a consistent source of guidance, 
          whether I wanted it or not. Danillo sees the best in me even when I’m at my “10 car deadline, day before Camp Fest” worst.</p>

        <p>He’s dependable in the way that makes you forget how rare that is. A quiet encourager. A steady presence. A human compass who has kept 
          me grounded while always pointing me toward something better.</p>

        <p>If you ever meet someone who embodies loyalty and wisdom—but can also roast you without blinking—congrats, you’ve met Danillo. And I’m lucky enough to call him my brother.</p>

        <h2>Groomsman – Caleb</h2>
        <p>You know how every great love story has that one chaotic, hilarious side character who somehow plays Cupid even though they can’t commit to a dinner reservation? That’s Caleb.</p>
        <p>My first best friend, my cousin, and Kindle’s longest friend, which basically makes him the social architect of this wedding. He introduced us, possibly thinking it would be temporary and funny. Plot twist: we fell in love. So yeah, Caleb, this is kind of your fault.</p>
        <p>He’s the guy who never needs a plan because he is the plan. The kind of cousin who will suggest skydiving at midnight, then show up with snacks and a backup parachute. Growing up, he was always ready to take the blame when something broke, got stained, or mysteriously disappeared. And somehow, my parents still like him better than me.</p>
        <p>Caleb is comedy wrapped in loyalty, chaos wrapped in heart. And while he’s always been the one cracking jokes, behind all the laughter is someone who’s been constant, courageous, and the best kind of trouble since day one. Every story needs a wild card. Caleb is ours.</p>

      <div class="groomsman-text">
        <h2>Groomsman – Connór</h2>
        <p>Ah yes, Connór — Kindle’s brother, but more importantly, the little brother I never knew I needed… until he showed up in my life with dry humor, blunt honesty, and an unsettling ability to read me.</p>
        <p>He’s the guy who will absolutely roast your haircut, question your taste in music, and then turn around and give you the most grounded, soul-punching advice you didn’t even know you needed. Steadfast. Driven. Inspiring in a quiet “lead-by-example” kind of way. And yes — absurdly talented, but too humble to ever admit it unless it involves anime rankings.</p>
        <p>We’ve shared some sacred brotherly milestones: I gave him his first hangover and the cure (hydration and greasy food — you’re welcome), taught him how to drive stick without crying (neither of us, shockingly), and found a shared emotional safe space in the form of late-night anime marathons and half-asleep couch cuddles.</p>
        <p>Connór isn’t loud about his love, but he shows up — fully, always. And that makes him not just a groomsman, but family in every sense of the word. And maybe our obsession with “My Hero Academia.” That runs deep.</p>
